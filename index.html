                Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a pioneering mathematician, logician, and computer scientist whose work laid the foundation for modern
                computing and artificial intelligence. His contributions during World War II were pivotal in the Allied victory, and his legacy
                continues to inspire innovation and ethical discussions in technology.
